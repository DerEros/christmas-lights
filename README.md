# christmas-lights
Small LED project for ESP8266 to drive WS2812 lights

## Notes

Make only works after patching Makefile such that it also scans header files
for includes and adds the included libraries to the autogenerated LIBS.

Modified Makefile line 177:
```
  LIBS := $(shell perl -e 'use File::Find;@d = split(" ", shift);while (<>) {$$f{"$$1"} = 1 if /^\s*\#include\s+[<"]([^>"]+)/;}find(sub {if ($$f{$$_}){print $$File::Find::dir," ";$$f{$$_}=0;}}, @d);' \
                          "$(CUSTOM_LIBS) $(ESP_LIBS) $(ARDUINO_LIBS)" $(SKETCH) $(call find_files,S|h|c|cpp,$(SKETCH_DIR)))
```

Added |h to scan header files as well.
